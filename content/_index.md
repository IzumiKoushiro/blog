Hello and welcome to my brain dump. Quite messy here â€” incoherence, inconsistency, lots of edits, lazy grammar & punctuation and so on. Everything is a working draft.

First exposure to computers in my primary school, I developed a great interest in it, and I have started learning programming by myself since then. But for reasons I have now forgotten, I put it aside. To my shame, the true time I approached the gate was last year. I still remember when I made friends with Bowa in school, we played [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net "Sandbox Survival, Adventure
Single-player + Multiplayer") together on a modded server, and he showed me how to code in Minecraft with [Lua](https://www.lua.org). It is amazing, how can you code in a game. And I suddenly remembered my dream when I was a child ~~(to be a hacker)~~, so I started
to ask Aunt Google how to start. 

1. The first one is [Python](https://www.python.org "Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively."). I read some articles and [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reasons-why-you-should-learn-python "12 Reasons Why You Should Learn Python") is one of them. But I gave it up quickly.

2. Next is [C++](https://isocpp.org). I was interested in Embedded Development then, so I also learned some but not deeply. And then, I decided to choose one to set as my main goal and study deeply.

3. So here is [Java](https://www.java.com) -- the third one. Java is used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gaming, big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications among other types. I also tried to build my own blog with the knowledge that I learned and I am still learning it now.

4. Gotta say, there should be a fourth one and yes it is [Go](https://go.dev "Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go"). I am planning to learn it because I wanna create my own hugo theme. There are lots of themes and every one of them is good, but barely one of them catches my eye. The papercss hugo theme I use now still lacks something that only exists in my brain, lol.

Back to me, I am still a student, shy so prefer to typewrite. Minecraft ign is *MeWannaFly* ~~(yes, IWannaFly is occupied)~~. I also run another webpage: [WindTavern](https://windtavern.com "A Tavern But Only Offer Milk."), I use it to put stories and books, go and take a look if you want. :p
