Sometimes I wish I was dust, so I could float anywhere and see those amazing views.

Sometimes I wish I was a bird, so I could fly high and wind is my best friend.

Sometimes I wish I was an otter, so I could pick my friends' hand and have a good sleep together.

Sometimes I wish I didn't have so many wishes, so I could be a boring person as they are.

~~Sometimes I wish I had never come into this world, so I could keep being ***MYSELF*** and never be changed.~~

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes...
