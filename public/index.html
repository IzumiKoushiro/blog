Hello and welcome to my brain dump. Quite messy here — incoherence, inconsistency, lots of edits, lazy grammar &amp; punctuation and so on. Everything is a working draft.
First exposure to computers in my primary school, I developed a great interest in it, and I have started learning programming by myself since then. But for reasons I have now forgotten, I put it aside. To my shame, the true time I approached the gate was last year. I still remember when I made friends with Bowa in school, we played Minecrafttogether on a modded server, and he showed me how to code in Minecraft with Lua. It is amazing, how can you code in a game. And I suddenly remembered my dream when I was a child (to be a hacker), so I started to ask Aunt Google how to start.">

<p>Hello and welcome to my brain dump. Quite messy here — incoherence, inconsistency, lots of edits, lazy grammar &amp; punctuation and so on. Everything is a working draft.</p>
<p>First exposure to computers in my primary school, I developed a great interest in it, and I have started learning programming by myself since then. But for reasons I have now forgotten, I put it aside. To my shame, the true time I approached the gate was last year. I still remember when I made friends with Bowa in school, we played 
<a href="https://www.minecraft.net" title="Sandbox Survival, Adventure
Single-player &#43; Multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    Minecraft
  </a> together on a modded server, and he showed me how to code in Minecraft with 
<a href="https://www.lua.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    Lua
  </a>. It is amazing, how can you code in a game. And I suddenly remembered my dream when I was a child <del>(to be a hacker)</del>, so I started
to ask Aunt Google how to start.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first one is 
<a href="https://www.python.org" title="Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    Python
  </a>. I read some articles and 
<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reasons-why-you-should-learn-python" title="12 Reasons Why You Should Learn Python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    this
  </a> is one of them. But I gave it up quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is 
<a href="https://isocpp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    C++
  </a>. I was interested in Embedded Development then, so I also learned some but not deeply. And then, I decided to choose one to set as my main goal and study deeply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So here is 
<a href="https://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    Java
  </a> &ndash; the third one. Java is used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gaming, big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications among other types. I also tried to build my own blog with the knowledge that I learned and I am still learning it now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotta say, there should be a fourth one and yes it is 
<a href="https://go.dev" title="Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    Go
  </a>. I am planning to learn it because I wanna create my own hugo theme. There are lots of themes and every one of them is good, but barely one of them catches my eye. The papercss hugo theme I use now still lacks something that only exists in my brain, lol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Back to me, I am still a student, shy so prefer to typewrite. Minecraft ign is <em>MeWannaFly</em> <del>(yes, IWannaFly is occupied)</del>. I also run another webpage: 
<a href="https://windtavern.com" title="A Tavern But Only Offer Milk." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    WindTavern
  </a>, I use it to put stories and books, go and take a look if you want. :p</p>
<span class="sidenote">
    <label class="sidenote-label" for="sidenote-1"><picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/images/chick_dark.png" width="80" height="80" align="left">
  <img alt="Young me." src="/images/chick.png" width="80" height="80" align="right">
</picture>
</label>
    <input class="sidenote-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="sidenote-1"></input>
    <span class="sidenote-content sidenote-right">
    Btw, this is me when I was young.
